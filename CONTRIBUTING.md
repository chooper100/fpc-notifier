# Contributing
It's great that you want to contribute to this project.

Here are some ways you can help:

## Reporting glitches
If you've noticed a glitch that hasn't yet been reported, a bug report would be
helpful! Make sure to include what you expected to happen along with what
actually happened.

However, please don't report out of date information here. Instead, a better
place for that would be on @thenextcurator's Scratch profile:
https://scratch.mit.edu/users/thenextcurator/

## Suggesting features
I'm always open to looking into new features for this extension. Please be aware
however there is a limit on what can be done.

For people looking into developing their own apps, I'm also interested in
feature suggestions for the API. You can view the FPC Notifier API homepage over
here:
http://scratchtools.tk/fpc/api/

To suggest a feature, simply open up a new issue with a description of your
feature idea, how it should work and why it would be useful.

## Pull requests
I'm also happy to accept code contributions from people. Please be aware that
pull requests adding new features may require prior discussion, particularly in
terms of keeping the design in line with the current theme.

Please be aware that I am currently following these code practices:
- Indentation uses 4 spaces
- JS and CSS string literals should generally use single quotes 
- HTML and JSON string literals should generally use double quotes
- The opening curly brace on a code block should be on the same line as the
  definition

If you could ensure that your code follows these, it would be helpful.

Thanks,
*Chooper*
